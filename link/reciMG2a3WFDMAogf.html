    <meta name="description" content="Since No Man&#x27;s Sky first came out, there have been many notable game-breaking bugs as well as many parts of the game that seemed too grindy and not much fun. Some of the bugs had workarounds or later patches to fix them, but others simply stopped your progress. Either way, I just want to enjoy the game!

After many tedious searches trying to find a solution, I came across a save editor that allowed me to make a change to the save file, but it was very limited in what it could do, and unless you were very careful you could screw up your save file completely. So I decided to rewrite it in Java for fun, with a simpler user interface, and as I dug deeper and added more functionality I decided to release it publicly. It has grown to become a pretty useful tool.">
